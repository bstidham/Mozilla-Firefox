# Mozilla Firefox - Extension - BS Local Filesystem Links

Forked from: https://github.com/feinstaub/webextension_local_filesystem_links/tree/0.99.47

0.99.47 is the first last version of Local Filesystem Links that does not require a separate add on application installed in the host operating system
I am using this extension in Waterfox which still supports legacy extensions
The reason I forked this extension is because I wanted to get rid of the context menu items that are cloggin up my context menu and interfering in other extension context menu items that I DO want to use, and to eventually add support for spaces in links. 
Adding an issue to the developer repo to implement these would not serve me well since I'm on a legacy version of the extension. 

# Installation
